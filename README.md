# Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer data to understand why customers leave (churn). It uses machine learning to predict churn and helps businesses improve retention.

## Files
- `churn_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data exploration, modeling, and visualizations.
- `telco_customer_churn.csv`: Dataset containing customer info and churn status.
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries needed.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open and run `churn_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Explore the visualizations and model results.

## Tools used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Public dataset from Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn

## Results
- Achieved accuracy of the churn prediction model.
- Visualized churn distribution and confusion matrix.
